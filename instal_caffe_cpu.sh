# Install the latest XCode (8.0).
#   We used to install the XCode Command Line Tools 7.3 here, but that would just upset the most recent versions of brew.
#   So we're going to install all our brew dependencies first, and then downgrade the tools. You can switch back after
#   you have installed caffe.

# Install the experimental NVIDIA Mac drivers
#   Download from http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/103826/en-us

#   Register and download from https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download 
#   or this path: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/assets/cudnn-8.0-osx-x64-v5.0-ga-tgz
#   extract to the NVIDIA CUDA folder and perform necessary linking

#   Do not install python through brew. Only misery lies there
#   We'll use the versions repository to get the right version of boost and boost-python
#   We'll also explicitly upgrade libpng because it's out of date
#   Do not install numpy via brew. Your system python already has it.

# Clone the caffe repo

#   First, we'll enable only CPU

#   In order to use the built-in Accelerate.framework, you have to reference it.
#   Astonishingly, nobody has written this anywhere on the internet.
#     BLAS := atlas
#     If you use El Capitan (10.11), we'll use the 10.11 sdk path for vecLib:
#       BLAS_INCLUDE := /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/Headers
#     Otherwise (10.12), let's use the 10.12 sdk path:
#       BLAS_INCLUDE := /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.12.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/Headers
#     BLAS_LIB := /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A
